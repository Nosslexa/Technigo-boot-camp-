  <!-- YOUR CODE GOES HERE: -->
  <h1>API  </h1>
    <h2>Application Programming Interface</h2>
    <h3>What does an API do?</h3>
    <div class="text">
    <p>It's an application intermediary that allows two applications, computers or programs to talk to each other. 
      <br> API´s can also control access to hardware devices or software functions. 
     That's why API often plays a role in security.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>

      <div class="text">
      <p>
        Imagine you are booking a flight on the internet at a site where you can compare different flights and prices.
         <br> API´s is what makes the site able to gather information about prices, dates and different departure and arrival times from the different airlines.</p>
        
    <p> Another example to explain an API is to compare it to a restaurant. <br>
You have a menu to order from. The Kitchen is the “system” and will prepare your order. <br> What you need now is the ability to communicate your order to the kitchen. <br>
This is where the API comes in, aka the waiter. <br>
The waiter takes your order/request to the kitchen who now can prepare your order. Then the waiter delivers the food back to you.
</p>
   <p>So in this example the API communicates your request to the system and then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted.
    </p>
